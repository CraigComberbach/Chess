/*
AI maximizes the ratio of total possible moves between Black and White. (This goes one turn into the game, without taking into account future turns)

eg. If piece A moves to location X, how many moves can I calculate from in this position, how many moves can my opponent move.

Taking a high value piece (Queen, Bishop, Rook and Knight) will be targeted for destruction as they have high mobility and would thus greatly diminish the opposing players number of moves

Grid[8][8][33]
grid[x][y][0]
-Physical layout of the board, detailing where all of the pieces are
-Pieces, instead of being stored as their type, are stored as unique numbers now (1-32)
-The reference to what the piece is, is stored in a different array
grid[x][y][1] to grid[x][y][32]
-The legal grids are referenced to the unique numbers of the piece (Piece 3 is grid[x][y][3])

status[22] keeps track of all of the pieces history (EG pawns and kings movement in the past), mostly just like the hasMoved structure.

gameVariables
-0 and 1 are the coordinates of the currently selected piece, "  " (Double space) is the none selected or initialized state
-2-20 are variable to expand into
